Ok, we are already in February, but I'm still trying to figure out my New Year's resolutions.

*Happy New Year!*

# The setup

I'm keeping the blog in [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and using a newer version of Jekyll with a [new theme]([Live Demo](https://sharadcodes.github.io/jekyll-theme-serial-programmer/)).

I'm trying Obsidian as the editing tool, as suggested in [this thread](https://x.com/kepano/status/1751355830103093375?s=20).

The site uses GA4 to collect basic analytics info. I didn't find any free alternative. Feel free to ping me if you know of one.

# The goal

Just to practice writing. It is a critical skill for an engineering manager and for any remote worker. Writing helps you to have more clarity, to think more carefully, and to communicate better.

It is also a good way to force me to learn: I pretend there are people reading me so I try to explain things in a way anybody can understand them. And that is one of the best ways I know to learn.

# The key

Consistency. As with some many things in life. We'll see.
