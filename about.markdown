I'm a software developer from [A Coru√±a](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fATgiA24RqDzozzz5) working with data and trying figure out how to use LLMs.

I use writing to learn, so I write here about stuff I'm interested about.

Currently at [Joor](https://www.joor.com/). See [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/javiercancela/).

Say hi [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/XavierCancela) or [by mail](mailto:javier.cancela@hey.com).
