I was really planning on dedicating more time to local models, but I just decided trying this game.

My gaming tastes a rather restricted: open-world games with a good story and, optionally, RPG features. So what I've played in the last decade (I really don't have that much time to play) is Baldur's Gate 3, Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption 2, The Witcher 3, GTA V, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, and Cyberpunk 2077, not in that order. I don't think I've completed any other game since I had my first kid (who is 13 now).

And since I have a [new computer]({% post_url 2025-09-19-local-llm-setup %}), well, you can't really not use it to play a little bit, right? I got a Windows partition just for that.
