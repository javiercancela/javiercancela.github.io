I was really planning on dedicating more time to local models, but I just decided to try this game.

My gaming tastes are rather restricted: open-world games with a good story and, optionally, RPG features. So what I've played in the last decade (I really don't have that much time to play) is Baldur's Gate 3, Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption 2, The Witcher 3, GTA V, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, and Cyberpunk 2077, not in that order. I don't think I've completed any other game since I had my first kid (who is 13 now).

And since I have a [new computer]({% post_url 2025-09-19-local-llm-setup %}), well, you can't really not use it to play a little bit, right? I got a Windows partition just for that.

Long story short, I've spent the last few weekends finishing one of the most beautiful games I've ever played. The story, the graphics, even the music, are superb. I'm not a fan of JRPGs, but this is a 10 out of 10.

One of the most remarkable aspects of the game is that it makes you feel emotionally invested in most of the characters. What I enjoyed the most was exploring their stories and developing the connections between them. It is a story about loss and grief, but also about identity, about moral responsibility, and other themes that seem more suited for a philosophy game than for a video game.

But there is also a very well-built combat system and an imaginative world-exploring mode. It is not an open-world game, but it makes you feel like an explorer anyway. It is an expedition, after all.

Now back to LLMs, Oblivion notwithstanding.
