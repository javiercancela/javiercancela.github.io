<em>Happy New Year!</em></p>

<h1 id="the-setup">The setup</h1>

<p>I’m keeping the blog in <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and using a newer version of Jekyll with a <a href="[Live Demo](https://sharadcodes.github.io/jekyll-theme-serial-programmer/)">new theme</a>.</p>

<p>I’m trying Obsidian as the editing tool, as suggested in <a href="https://x.com/kepano/status/1751355830103093375?s=20">this thread</a>.</p>

<p>The site uses GA4 to collect basic analytics info. I didn’t find any free alternative. Feel free to ping me if you know of one.</p>

<h1 id="the-goal">The goal</h1>

<p>Just to practice writing. It is a critical skill for an engineering manager and for any remote worker. Writing helps you to have more clarity, to think more carefully, and to communicate better.</p>

<p>It is also a good way to force me to learn: I pretend there are people reading me so I try to explain things in a way anybody can understand them. And that is one of the best ways I know to learn.</p>

<h1 id="the-key">The key</h1>

<p>Consistency. As with some many things in life. We’ll see.</p>]]></content><author><name>Javier Cancela</name><email>javier.cancela@hey.com</email></author><category term="misc" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok, we are already in February, but I’m still trying to figure out my New Year’s resolutions.]]></summary></entry></feed>
